G'day,
my name is Daniel Nickel. I'm a 16 year old student and hobby developer from west germany.
I saw <a href="https://floooh.github.io/">floooh's github page</a> and instantly wanted to do the same.
So here am I.

This will be a personal blog all about programming, my projects, cs journey and education.
This is a project for education, my resume and maybe helping others.

This is my first entry in a hopefully long series of posts on this website. Hope you're going to enjoy them.

Thank you for reading and have a nice day.

<i>Nickel.</i>
