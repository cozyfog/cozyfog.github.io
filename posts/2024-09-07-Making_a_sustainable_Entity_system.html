			Game and engine developers fear two things.
			Big classes and memory management.
      
			And I think I have figured it out.
			It is simple to get around those problems and I will show you using entities.
			Entites in video games are probably the most import concept.
			But they are also one of the hardest to get right.
			
      Every game engine handles them differently.
      <pre>
        Unity - GameObject
        Unreal - Actor
        Godot - Node
				...
      </pre>
      But the most perfect system I have seen so far for indie games, is probably the most unpopular.
      It is called the Entity Mega Struct.

      <i>// This post is mainly based on the YouTube talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UolgW-Ff4bA&t=881s&pp=ygUYZW50aXR5IG1lZ2Egc3RydWN0IHJhbmR5">Why an ECS just ain't it - feat. Ryan Fleury</a> and my own experiences over the years.</i>
<div class="section"><h3>Entities</h3>
      A popular way to handle Entites, that has been talked about lately, is the ECS.
      An ECS (or Entity Component System) sees entites as id's wich then point to it's Components.
      This makes allocating Components easier and keep the data of the entity seperate from the code (or systems).

      An example for such an ECS could be this:
      <pre><code class="language-c">
struct Transform_Component;
struct Sprite_Component;
...

// Move by 5m per second
void move_player(Entity entity) {
	Transform_Component* t = get_transform_component(entity);
	t->pos.y += 5.0f * delta_t;
}

// Draw the sprite
void draw_entity(Entity entity) {
	Transform_Component* t = get_transform_component(entity);
	Sprite_Component* s = get_sprite_component(entity);
	draw_image(s->image, t->pos, t->size);
}
    </code></pre>
			But such a solution introduces new problems.
			Those can be simply overcomplication, or you needing to get every single component.
			Making such a system is just nonsensical for most indie devs.

			In my opinion a better way to solve the entity problem is this:
      All entites are is data.
      An entity in a game can just be represented by a single struct.
			This is called an Entity Mega Struct. This struct contains every piece of data an entity is every goint to need.
      <pre><code class="language-c">
struct Entity {
	bool_t is_active;
	vec2_t  pos;
	vec2_t size;
	sprite_t sprite;
	...
};
      </code></pre>
			But now we need to think about how we store all of the entites.

			There are three main solution I have tried over time. And I can tell you all of the pros and cons of those.
			Firstly, the most primitive, the <i>I don't care just do it</i>

			In this case we just create and free entites as we go.
			This is simple and for a very small game easy to keep track of.
			If you want to you can even define all of the entities in global scope.
      <pre><code class="language-c">
// Global scope
Entity player = 0;
Entity treasure1 = 0;

void update(float delta_t) {
	player.pos.x += 5.0f * delta_t;
}
      </code></pre>
			But the problem is that the moment you have more than like 20 entities, it will get messy.
			It's also not very scalable.
      <pre><code class="language-c">
Entity player = 0;
Entity treasure1 = 0;
Entity treasure2 = 0;
Entity treasure3 = 0;
Entity ball = 0;
Entity ogre1 = 0;
Entity ogre2 = 0;
Entity ogre3 = 0;
Entity ogre4 = 0;
Entity coin = 0;
...
      </code></pre>

			This is why you should opt for the memory arena.
			<i>// If you want to hear more about memory arenas: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IAlJSIjvH0">Arenas, strings and Scuffed Templates in C</a></i>

			In a memory arena you allocate all the memory that is going to be used at once.
			Then you just access this pointer and just offset it to get the memorty you need.
			<pre><code class="language-c">
Entity* entities = 0;
size_t entity_count = 0;

void allocate_entities() {
	// calloc automatically sets everything to zero
	entites = (Entity*)calloc(MAX_ENTITIES, sizeof(Entity));
}

void deallocate_entities() {
	free(entities);
}

Entity* new_entity() {
	entity_count += 1;
	return entities + (entity_count - 1);
}

void delete_entity(Entity* entity) {
	memset(entity, 0, sizeof(Entity));
}
      </code></pre>
			This design is super elegant and not very hard to manage.
			You don't have to think about memory anymore.
			When you are finished with an area, level or even a game state (Menu -> Game), you can just free the arena and allocate a new one.

			This is probably the best way of managing entities for level based games, but if you want to make a sandbox for example you will need something different.
			The <i>Put everything in an array</i>, putting everything in an array makes it more easy to reuse old entities.
			<pre><code class="language-c">
Entity entities[MAX_ENTITIES];

Entity* new_entity() {
	Entity* result = 0;
	for (size_t i = 0; i &lt MAX_ENTITIES; i++) {
		result = &entities[i];
		if (result->is_active == false)
			return result;
	}
	printf("Entity limit exceeded!\n");
	return 0;
}

void delete_entity(Entity* entity) {
	memset(entity, 0, sizeof(Entity));
}
      </code></pre>
			The only downside is, that it is not as easy to clear out the array.
			<i>// This is probably the only difference to the arena to be honest</i>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Systems</h3>
			The last thing we now have to think about is the systems.
			like already mentioned in the ECS section, systems are the functions that manipulate the entities data. Those are what the game is mostly build up from.
			The only quiestion you may now have is, how do we design a modular systems structure?
			And this is actually the easiest part.
			I like to divide systems in major and minor systems.
			The major systems are made up of minor systems.
			<pre><code class="language-c">
// minor systems
vec2_t get_input_axis() {
	return vec2(is_key_down(KEY_d) - is_key_down(KEY_a),
	            is_key_down(KEY_w) - is_key_down(KEY_s));
}

void draw_sprite(sprite_t sprite) {
	...
}

// major system
void update_player(Entity* player) {
	player->pos = vec2_add(player->pos, get_input_axis());
	draw_sprite(player->sprite);
	...
}
      </code></pre>
			Major systems in basic can take in entity pointers as parameters, while minor systems can only take simple data like floats, vectors or sprite components.
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Conclusion</h3>
    	Most of the stuff written here is probably obvious and actually very simple in nature.
			But looking at things from a different perspective, or talking about the simple things, helps in building up stronger foundations.
